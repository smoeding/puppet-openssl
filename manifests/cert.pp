# @summary Manage an X.509 certificate file in PEM format
#
# @example Install the 'imap' cert in the default location
#
#   openssl::cert { 'imap': }
#
# @example Install the 'postgresql' cert using application specific defaults
#
#   openssl::cert { 'postgresql':
#     cert     => $::hostname,
#     owner    => 'root',
#     group    => 'postgres',
#     mode     => '0444',
#     cert_dir => '/etc/postgresql',
#     source   => $::hostname,
#   }
#
# @param ensure
#   The state of the resource.
#
# @param cert
#   The basename of the file where the certificate will be stored on the
#   client. The full filename will be created using the three components
#   `cert_dir`, `cert` and `extension`.
#
# @param source
#   The basename of the file where the certificate is stored on the server.
#   The full filename will be created using the three parameters
#   `cert_source_directory` (see the base class `openssl`), `source` and
#   `source_extension`.
#
# @param cert_chain
#   An array of certificate names that are should be added to the certificate
#   file. This allows the generation of certificate chains to provide a full
#   verification path for the certificate if intermediate CAs are used. The
#   chain is included in the generated certificate file. The certificates
#   must be available in `cert_source_directory` on the server just like the
#   ordinary certificate.
#
#   This parameter can't be used if `managed_trust` is set to `true`.
#
# @param extension
#   The file extension used for files created on the client.
#
# @param source_extension
#   The file extension used for files read on the server.
#
# @param manage_trust
#   A boolean value that determines if the certificate should be marked as a
#   trusted certificate. The mark is set if the parameter value is `true` and
#   removed if the parameter value is `false`. This is mostly useful for CA
#   certificates to establish a proper trust chain.
#
#   On Debian based distributions this is done by creating a symbolic link
#   pointing to the certificate file using the certificate hash as name.
#
#   On RedHat based distributions the certificate is added to the system-wide
#   NSS database in `/etc/pki/nssdb`. The `certutil` binary is required for
#   this. The value of the parameter `cert` is used as the nickname for the
#   certificate. Do not try to add the same certificate a second time with a
#   different nickname to the database. This will fail silently and Puppet
#   will try to add the certificate on every subsequent run.
#
#   If this parameter is set to `true` then the certificate chain must
#   be empty.
#
# @param mode
#   The file mode used for the resource.
#
# @param owner
#   The file owner used for the resource.
#
# @param group
#   The file group used for the resource.
#
# @param cert_dir
#   The destination directory on the client where the certificate will be
#   stored.
